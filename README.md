rhythmbox-vk
============

rhythmbox-3 plugin for vk.com

by Radist Morse

NOTES:

Working with rhythmbox-2.98

INSTALLATION:
1. cd ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins
2. git clone https://github.com/radistmorse/rhythmbox-vk.git vk
3. Switch the plugin on
4. Press "configure" and provide three needed variables.
I really don't know how it should be obtained. I myself found it in similar
 scripts, but as it's kind of secret/personal I don't provide it.

USAGE:
1. Enter the search line and press "Search"
2. You can play the tracks right from the results tab, or you can move it to default playlist
4. Press "clear" to clear the results

TODO:
1. Ability to download tracks
2. Ability to add tracks to the library permanently
3. (probably not going to happen) An UI to extract the needed variables automatically
